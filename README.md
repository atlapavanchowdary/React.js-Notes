# React.js-Notes
About React.js 

How does a component render in React.js:

In React, the rendering process is a fundamental aspect of how components work. When a React application is running, it undergoes a process known as the "reconciliation" process, during which it determines what changes need to be made to the user interface in response to changes in state or props. Here's a high-level overview of how a component renders:

1. Initial Rendering:
When a React component is initially mounted in the DOM (either in the ReactDOM.render() method or as a child of another component), React triggers the rendering process.
The render method of the component is called.

2. Virtual DOM:
The render method returns a virtual representation of the UI, often referred to as the Virtual DOM. This is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM.

3. Reconciliation:
React compares the virtual representation of the UI with the previous version of the virtual DOM to identify differences.
This process is known as reconciliation and is done to determine the most efficient way to update the actual DOM.

4. Differences (Diffing) Calculation:
React calculates the differences (diffing) between the new virtual DOM and the previous one. It identifies what parts of the DOM need to be updated.

5. Reconciliation Algorithm:
React uses a reconciliation algorithm to minimize the number of DOM manipulations required. It aims to update only the parts of the DOM that have changed.

6. Update DOM:
React applies the calculated changes to the actual DOM. This could involve adding, updating, or removing DOM elements.

7. Lifecycle Methods:
During the rendering process, React invokes certain lifecycle methods such as componentDidMount (for the initial render) or componentDidUpdate (for subsequent updates).

8. Re-rendering:
Changes in state or props trigger a re-render of the component. React will repeat the process from step 3 onward.
